The for loop with 4 iterations in the provided eBPF code is crucial for ensuring that the packet headers are properly parsed without accessing invalid memory, which could lead to errors or potential security issues
By performing these checks, the eBPF program ensures that it safely and correctly processes only the relevant packets, thereby maintaining stability and security in the system.
